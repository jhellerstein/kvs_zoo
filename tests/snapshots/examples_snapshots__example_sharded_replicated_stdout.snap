🚀 Sharded + Replicated KVS Demo
📋 Topology: 3 shards × 3 replicas = 9 nodes
Cluster specification (tree structure):
  Shards (cluster.count): 3
  Replicas per shard (node.count): 3
  Total nodes: 9
   → shard 1 for 'user:alice'
   → shard 1 for 'user:bob'
   → shard 1 for 'user:alice'
   → shard 1 for 'user:bob'
→ PUT user:alice = OK
→ PUT user:bob = OK
→ GET user:alice = x
→ GET user:bob = y
✅ Sharded+Replicated demo complete
