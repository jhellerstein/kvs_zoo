///
/// 1. **Consistent Hashing**: Keys are hashed and modulo'd by shard count
/// 2. **Specialized Proxy**: Proxy calculates shard for each key and unicasts to specific cluster member
/// 3. **Independent Shards**: Each shard maintains its own local KVS state
/// 4. **No Cross-Shard Communication**: Shards operate independently for maximum performance
///
/// ## Architecture

///       â†“
/// Shard 0  Shard 1  Shard 2  ...
